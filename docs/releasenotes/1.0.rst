Review Bot 1.0 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: TBD


This is the first public release of Review Bot. Review Bot is a tool which
integrates with Review Board 3.0 and newer which can run static analysis tools
on prospective code changes and post the results as a :ref:`status update
<rb3.0:status-updates>` on the review request.

Review Bot has two major components: ``reviewbot-extension``, a Review Board
extension which triggers the tools, and ``reviewbot-worker``, a service which
runs the tools. It also requires an AMQP server, such as RabbitMQ_.

This release includes support for the following tools:

* :ref:`BuildBot "try" <reviewbot1.0:tool-buildbot>`
* :ref:`Clang Static Analyzer <reviewbot1.0:tool-clang>`
* :ref:`Cppcheck <reviewbot1.0:tool-cppcheck>`
* :ref:`CppLint <reviewbot1.0:tool-cpplint>`
* :ref:`flake8 <reviewbot1.0:tool-flake8>`
* :ref:`JSHint <reviewbot1.0:tool-jshint>`
* :ref:`PMD <reviewbot1.0:tool-pmd>`
* :ref:`pycodestyle <reviewbot1.0:tool-pycodestyle>`
* :ref:`pyflakes <reviewbot1.0:tool-pyflakes>`
